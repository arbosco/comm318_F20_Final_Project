This file is a list of all of the data_analysis notebooks I have used to generate my story. Each is listed with the name of the notebook along with a brief description of what I am doing in that notebook. Thanks!

## Data Exploration Notebooks:

- importing_data = In this initial notebook I uploaded the first few data frames I was going to work with. This included the Top-50 player rankings (including a whole .csv of statistics for each player that made the list) for the past 10 fantasy football seasons (2010-2019). 

- data_analysis_1 = This analysis notebook looks closer at the Top-50 fantasy football player statistics from each of the 10 years. It gives a general analysis of each individual data set, an overall analysis, it includes a key for terms that are abbreviated in the tables, and lastly this notebook has a markdown cell in which I gave a list of potential questions to explore further in my later analysis notebooks.

- initial_data_exploration_1 = In this analysis notebook I began to compare the tables from each of the 10 years. I began to look closer at each table and eve pulled out just the top-10 or so players and conducted an analysis on certain aspects/statistics. I looked at the breakdown of positions and which positions were most commonly found in these tables. I created joint data frames of the Top-50 players from each year, the Top-10 players from each year and also a combined data frame of the Top player from each year. I also uploaded 2 more data frames in this notebook. One was a table of the past 10 National Football League MVPs and the second was a list of the past 10 Super Bowl Champions and Runner-ups. This notebook contains 5 question blocks with follow-up questions within the blocks. 

- cleaned_initial_data_exploration_1 = This notebook is the 'initial_data_exploration' cleaned up with markdown cells and analysis. This is the notebook I used to complete assignment 6. It has the same data as the previous notebook just includes the proper question, analysis, answer format.

- player_analysis = This notebook is an in-depth analysis of the players who have appeared most frequently in these Top tables. Specifically, an in-depth analysis of the 5 players who have appeared most (they have made the table for Top-50 fantasy players in that years regular season). I then uploaded a new data frame, 'player salaries'. This is a table of the Top-20 average salaries of NFL players in 2020. And lastly, I created some visualizations to include in my blog post using these data frames.

- Draft Recommendations Analysis = I uploaded a new data frame that included an employee from the NFL's specific recommendations for drafting players in a Fantasy Football Draft. I compared this data with the analyses I had made in previous notebook and came to some conclusions and explanations as to why he would recommend when to draft certain positions (and why and why not).

- trying_out_visualizations = This notebook is like a scrap notebook in which I loaded most of my data frames and played around with certain charts and graphs to try to formulate the best visualizations that would help me push my storyline forward.
