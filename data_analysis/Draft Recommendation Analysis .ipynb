    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a new data frame 'draft_recommendations'. It a complete guide to drafting a fantasy team that the nfl believes will lead you to victory. I have compared this with what I analyzed through my initial data analysis, player analysis, and salary analysis and have made some further observations on to why I believe their recommendations are different than the positional breakdown I found and would have therefore assumed to front the first few rounds worth of draft picks.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is stated in their guide is slightly different than what I would have thought from my code BUT.. I have found and thought on my own of some explanation as to why which I will explain both here and in my final blog. In the end...it all makes sense and fits the story. I will show you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file I am loading into this notebook is from NFL's website: https://www.nfl.com/news/the-perfect-round-by-round-fantasy-draft-strategy-0ap3000000509944\n",

You not only need multiple of these position in your line-up BUT...there are only few players in these positions who generate enough points to break into the Top-50.
