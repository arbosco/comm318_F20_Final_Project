## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

## How to draft the most successful fantasy football team?
When I was just 16 years old my family decided to start our own fantasy football league. A league consisting of my brother, dad, uncles, grandpa and some family friends. Being the only girl in the league I was determined to dominate...unfortunately I have yet to be very successful. I decided to take this as an opportunity to not only educate myself but educate others who want to dominate in the fantasy football game but don't exactly know where to start.

This story outlines "A Total Guide to Success in Fantasy Football". It ranges from where you should do research, what order you should pick your players, and what factors go into a players success in generating a lot of fantasy points. This storyline outlines this all from head-to-toe.


## What makes a player a successful fantasy point scorer?
Never before having done research to draft the best team possible I looked to a few different places to gain some knowledge and guidance. I began to look for correlations in successful point generating players. From what teams they were on, what positions they play, how many times they've been in the Top of the ranks, if they've won MVP, if their team appeared in the Super Bowl within the past 10 years AND I even looked for a correlation between fantasy performance and salary. 

If you want an outline into how these factors play into the success of players in fantasy football, give my "Total Guide to Fantasy Football: Patterns, Projections, and More" a read!

Thank you and I hope you come in 1st place next season!

Best,
