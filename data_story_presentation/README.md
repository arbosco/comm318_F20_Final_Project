## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

### What information can help us in drafting a successful Fantasy Football Team?

### How do you know which players to pick?

This presentation is titled "A Total Guide to Fantasy Football: Patterns, Projections & More". It is a blog post that analyzes fantasy football, in which you select a team comprised of each position in the NFL of the best players all across the League. You try to draft the best possible team in order to generate points to beat other drafted teams.

This blog post is the analysis of the past 10 years of fantasy football history & statistics. It goes into which players have dominated in the game and is the domination in fantasy football correlated at all to League MVP winners and average salary. I also did a positional breakdown to gain insight on the positions that generate the most amount of points. This gave me insight into how to formulate the best fantasy team. I also gained insight in the consistency level of players who have reappeared on the Top of the charts year after year. I will go into how it is worth it to take risks on players who had breakout seasons. For many of them reappeared on the top of the list the year after that and even years after that. I go into more detail in my final blog post.

Along with creating a blog post on python I have also published it on Medium.com, this is an easy read for any one interested in the sport of fantasy football or looking to get interested. You can access my story using the link below:
