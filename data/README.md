## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Hello! This is a folder containing all of the data frames that I used in this analysis and blog post. All of these files were tables found on the internet that I had to transfer out to excel and then save as a .csv file. Here I will give a brief explanation of each data frame I used.
